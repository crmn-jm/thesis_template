\section{Motivation}\label{sec_motivation}

This template has been created specifically for the defence of Thesis~\cite{tesis}. If you make use of this template or base your work on it, please provide proper attribution or reference to its original source.



\section{Aims and objectives}\label{sec_aims}

This template uses the \texttt{acronym} package to manage abbreviations consistently throughout the text. Acronyms should be defined inside the \texttt{acronym} environment and referenced in the text using dedicated commands. The usage is summarised below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|\ac{cd}| — On first use, prints the full name followed by the acronym in parentheses: \ac{CNN}. Later uses show only the acronym: \ac{CNN}.
    
    \item \verb|\acs{cd}| — Prints only the short form (the acronym), even on first use: \acs{AD}.
    
    \item \verb|\acl{cd}| — Prints only the long form (the full name): \acl{CNN}.
    
    \item \verb|\acf{cd}| — Always prints the full name and acronym: \acf{AD}.
    
    \item \verb|\acp{cd}| — Prints the plural form, automatically adding an “s” to the acronym and adjusting the long form if defined: \acp{CNN}.
\end{itemize}

All acronyms must be defined in the \texttt{acronym} environment.
